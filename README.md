On the left you'll see my design and on the right is the image challenge. 


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- bootstrap

### What I learned

This product was good in helping me to practice using and designing bootstrap components to match a desired outcome. 

I didn't completely fully the instructions to create the correct sizing for different screens since I was focusing on practicing with bootstrap instead.


### Weaknesses

- My limitations was that fontelements shopping cart wasnt showing up so I add to opt for an emoji shopping cart which doesn't look as nice. 

- I was unable to determine the exact font to match the project perfectly.
